#### About Leader's Digest

Since I've been leading teams, my uptake on leadership, culture and engineering
management related content has grown considerably. Be it blog posts, books,
newsletters or whatever. A large source of inspiration has been [Oren
Ellenbogen's "Software Lead Weekly"](http://softwareleadweekly.com/), which I
regularly enjoy immensely.

However every new source of content and inspiration always adds onto the amount
of information one has to consume and evaluate. And I think almost everybody
knows that feeling of anxiety of missing out on something, on that one great
blog post everyone is talking about. So, while I enjoy reading up on a lot of
new ideas, experience reports and what not, having this flood of information
come at me, sometimes triggers negative and not-so-helpful feelings. 

So after a while I thought, that while there's so much great content out there,
there's only so much one can read and process. And instead of working through so
many articles and thoughts, why not work only through a single one per week.
Should be enough, right?

That's when [Leader's Digest](http://leaders-dige.st/) was born.

I owe the name Leader's Digest to two bright fellows,
[Marc](https://twitter.com/marcdix/status/643402723417812992) &
[Benno](https://twitter.com/bkittelmann/status/643389952512892928), who
came up with the name after I [asked for name suggestions on
twitter](https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/643358895273021440).

I'm a software developer at heart, who over the last years discovered immense
enjoyment in working more on the people side of software development, mainly as
a manager.

Currently I'm in charge of all things technical aka CTO at the Frankfurt-based
Financial Services Startup [vaamo](https://www.vaamo.de).

Besides collaborating with people on delivering useful solutions, I also enjoy
organizing conferences such as the [SoCraTes](http://www.socrates-conference.de)
and usergroups like the local [DevOps
usergroup](http://www.meetup.com/de/DevOps-Frankfurt/).

In addition to sharing my knowledge and exchanging experiences in-person where
possible, I ...

- ... maintain a blog at [squeakyvessel.com](http://squeakyvessel.com)
- ... [give talks](http://squeakyvessel.com/speaking/) at conferences and meetups
- ... I tweet stuff as [@benjamin](https://twitter.com/benjamin)
